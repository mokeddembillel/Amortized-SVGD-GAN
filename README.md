# Implementation of Amortized Stien Variational Gradient Descent 

Based on the paper : [Learning to draw samples: with application to amortized maximum likelihood estimator for generative adversarial learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01722)

I believe this is the only new Implementation of Amortized SVGD in Pytorch since the old version from 5 years ago using Chainer framework [Chainer Implementation](https://github.com/musyoku/ddgm)

here are some examples

![This one not very well](Gaussain_2.gif)

![and this one doesn't work at all](Gaussain_3.gif)

this is as far as i've got, so if anyone would be interested to help, you're all welcome
